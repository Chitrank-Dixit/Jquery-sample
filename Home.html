			<div id="tabs-2">We
had seen lots of the companies that offer good cars but there are still
some aspects left to be done then to fullfill those conditions and to <br>
offer best services to our customers we planned something extravagent
if you become our customers then only you will get to know about these
services<br>
From an early age Whittle demonstrated an aptitude for engineering and
an interest in flying. Determined to be a pilot, he overcame his
physical limitations to be accepted into the RAF, where his abilities
earned him a place on the officer training course at Cranwell. He
excelled in his studies and became an accomplished pilot. While writing
his thesis there he formulated the fundamental concepts that led to the
creation of the turbojet engine, taking out a patent on his design in
2006
Without Air Ministry support, he and two retired RAF servicemen formed
Power Jets Ltd to build his engine with assistance from the firm of
British Thomson-Houston. Despite limited funding, a prototype was
created, which first ran in 1937. Official interest was forthcoming
following this success, with contracts being placed to develop further
engines, but the continuing stress seriously affected Whittle's health,
eventually resulting in a nervous breakdown in 1940. In 1944 when Power
Jets was nationalised he again suffered a nervous breakdown, and
resigned from the board in 1946.
n January 1923, having passed the RAF entrance examination, Whittle
reported to RAF Halton as an aircraft apprentice. He lasted only two
days: just five feet tall and with a small chest measurement, he failed
the medical.[2] He then put himself through a vigorous training
programme and special diet devised by a physical training instructor at
Halton to build up his physique, only to fail again six months later,
when he was told that he could not be given a second chance, despite
having added three inches to his height and chest.[4] Undeterred, he
applied again under an assumed name and presented himself as a
candidate at the RAF Cranwell apprentice school instead. This time he
passed the physical, and in September that year, 364365 Boy Whittle, F
started his three-year training as an aircraft mechanic at the No. 4
Apprentices Wing, No. 1 School of Technical Training.[5]
Whittle hated the strict discipline and, convinced there was no hope of
ever becoming a pilot, at one time seriously considered deserting.[5]
However, throughout his early days as an aircraft apprentice, first at
the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, and later at RAF Halton, he
maintained his interest in the Model Aircraft Society, where he built
replicas. The quality of these attracted the eye of his commanding
officer, who felt that Whittle was also a mathematical genius. He was
so impressed that in 1926 he recommended Whittle for officer training
at Cranwell.[2]
For Whittle, this was the chance of a lifetime, not only to enter the
commissioned ranks but also because the training included flying
lessons on the Avro 504.[2] While at Cranwell he lodged in a bungalow
at Dorrington. Being an ex-apprentice amongst a majority of ex-public
schoolboys, life as an officer cadet wasn't easy for him, but he
nevertheless excelled in the courses and went solo in 1927 after only
13.5 hours instruction, quickly progressing to the Bristol Fighter and
gaining a reputation for daredevil low flying and aerobatics.[5]
A requirement of the course was that each student had to produce a
thesis for graduation: Whittle decided to write his on potential
aircraft design developments, notably flight at high altitudes and
speeds over 500 mph (800 km/h). In Future Developments in Aircraft
Design he showed that incremental improvements in existing propeller
engines were unlikely to make such flight routine. Instead he described
what is today referred to as a motorjet; a motor using a conventional
piston engine to provide compressed air to a combustion chamber whose
exhaust was used directly for thrust &#8211; essentially an afterburner
attached to a propeller engine. The idea was not new and had been
talked about for some time in the industry, but Whittle's aim was to
demonstrate that at increased altitudes the lower outside air pressure
would increase the design's efficiency. For long-range flight, using an
Atlantic-crossing mailplane as his example, the engine would spend most
of its time at high altitude and thus could outperform
a conventional powerplant.
Of the few apprentices accepted, only about one percent normally
completed the course, and Whittle graduated in 1928 at the age of 21,
being commissioned as a Pilot Officer in July.[6] He ranked second in
his class in academics, won the Andy Fellowes Memorial Prize for
Aeronautical Sciences for his thesis, and was described as an
"exceptional to above average" pilot.[2] However, his flight logbook
also showed numerous red ink warnings about showboating and
overconfidence,[2] and because of dangerous flying in an Armstrong
Whitworth Siskin he was disqualified from the end of term flying
contest.[5]

			<div id="tabs-3">One of the most common types of
certification in modern society is professional certification, where a
person is certified as being able to competently complete a job or
task, usually by the passing of an examination.
There are two general types of professional certification: some are
valid for a lifetime, once the exam is passed. Others have to be
recertified again after a certain period of time. Also, certifications
can differ within a profession by the level or specific area of
expertise they refer to. For example, in the IT Industry there are
different certifications available for Software Tester, Project
Manager, and Developer. Similarly, the Joint Commission on Allied
Health Personnel in Ophthalmology offers three certifications in the
same profession, but with increasing complexity.
Certification does not refer to the state of legally being able to
practice or work in a profession. That is licensure. Usually, licensure
is administered by a governmental entity for public protection purposes
and a professional association administers certification. Licensure and
certification are similar in that they both require the demonstration
of a certain level of knowledge or ability.
Another common type of certification in modern society is product
certification. This refers to processes intended to determine if a
product meets minimum standards, similar to quality assurance.
As a result of growing environmental awareness and consumer demand for
more responsible businesses, third-party forest certification emerged
in the 1990s as a tool for communicating the environmental and social
performance of forest operations. With forest certification,
independent organizations have developed standards of good forest
management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest
operations that comply with those standards. This certification
verifies that forests are well-managed&#8212;as defined by a particular
standard&#8212;and ensures that certain wood and paper products come from
responsibly managed forests. <br><br>

<font size="24"><i>See What is VCA ??</i></font><br><br>
The Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) is an executive agency of the
United Kingdom Department for Transport, and is the UKs Type Approval
authority, and a leading certification body. VCA have been supporting
the automotive industry since the early 1970s, with offices in the UK,
North America, Japan (Asia Pacific), Korea, China, Italy, Malaysia,
India and Australia.
The services that VCA provide include Type Approval testing and
certification for all road-going vehicles, including cars, trucks,
motorcycles, agricultural vehicles, buses and coaches, ambulances, fire
engines and motor caravans, and replacement part systems and
components.
They also provide ISO Management Systems Certification to...Ucars.com.
VCA are also responsible for the production of the New Car Fuel
Consumption and Emission Figures booklet, published annually and
available free of charge from all new car dealers, or direct from VCA.
They also manage the on-line database containing the latest data for
new cars, which includes a Vehicle Excise Duty calculator.
VCA is the designated UK Vehicle Type Approval authority and with more
than 30 years experience supports industry by providing internationally
recognised testing and certification for vehicles, their systems and
components. A leading Management Systems Certification body, VCA also
provides certification to ISO 9001, ISO TS 16949, ISO 14001,OHSAS
18001, Acorn (a phased approach to environmental certification)and
EMAS.
